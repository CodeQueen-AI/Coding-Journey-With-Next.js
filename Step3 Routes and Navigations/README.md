# Routes in Next.js
In Next.js, routes are created by adding files to the pages folder. Each file name becomes a route, like about.txs making the /about route

# Navigation in Next.js
Navigation is used to move between pages. You use the `Link` component to create clickable links that lead to different pages in your app.
